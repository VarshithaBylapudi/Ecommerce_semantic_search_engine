# 🛒 E-commerce Semantic Search & Review Analytics Engine

An NLP-powered application for searching, analyzing, and visualizing Amazon product reviews using semantic search and sentiment analysis.

## Overview

Traditional keyword search often fails to understand the intent behind a user's query. This project addresses that limitation by using vector embeddings and ChromaDB to perform semantic search over product reviews.

The application also includes an interactive analytics dashboard for exploring customer sentiment, rating distributions, brand performance, and review trends.

## Features

### 🔍 Semantic Search

* Search reviews using natural language queries
* Retrieve contextually relevant reviews instead of exact keyword matches
* Powered by Sentence Transformers and ChromaDB

### 😊 Sentiment Analysis

* Classifies reviews as Positive, Neutral, or Negative
* Built using VADER Sentiment Analysis

### 📊 Analytics Dashboard

* Sentiment distribution
* Rating distribution
* Brand-level statistics
* Review trends over time
* Dataset summary metrics
